# Multiclass-Classification-by-one-vs-all-strategy-using-Logistic-Regression-from-Scratch-using-numpy

This repository contains Python code implementing multiclass classification using logistic regression from scratch. The code is applied to the Iris dataset using the one-vs-all strategy.

## Overview

In this project, logistic regression is implemented without using any machine learning libraries such as scikit-learn. The goal is to classify iris flowers into three species (setosa, versicolor, and virginica) based on four features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width).

## Files

- `logistic_regression.ipynb`: Python notbeook containing the implementation of logistic regression and the one-vs-all strategy.
- `requirements.txt`: Contains the requirements to run the code.

## Usage

To run the code, simply use the `logistic_regression.ipynb` notebook. Make sure you have requirements installed or you can just install them by after cloning the repo:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
or just install them using the notebook ```logistic_regression.ipynb``` using pip.

Yes its that simple üßÅ
